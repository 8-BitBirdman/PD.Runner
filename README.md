## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions
**1. Why do I need to enter a password when first run?**  
> Because of the new authentication measure introduced in PD 17.1.0, you need to bypass it by quickly switching the system time. A "Privileged Helper" needs to be installed on the system to change the time.  
> If you don't do this, you will need to enter the password every time you start an VM.  

**2. Why does PD Runner start without any windows?**  
>PD Runner is a menu-based application, it only show an icon in the menu bar for use after starting, and there is no main window.  

**3. Do I need to change the VM to a specific name to use it?**  
> No, PD Runner can automatically list the VMs in the current system automatically.  

**4. I get an error message when installing the helper**  

- If you see the error code "**Domain=CFError DomainLaunchd Code=9**"  

> Please run the following command in Terminal and enter the password. Then restart PD Runner and it will work normally.  
> `sudo launchctl enable system/com.lihaoyun6.PD-Runner-Helper`  

- If the system say "**「com.lihaoyun6.pd-runner-helper」 will damage your computer.**"  
> This is caused by the expiration of the temporary developer certificate I used. Use the "Uninstall-Helper" app included in the release to remove the residual items of the old version, and then reopen PD runner normally.
